Image Classification Using MobileNetV2

Summary of Code

The code below is to demonstrate how to use a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify an image and display the top predicted labels along with their confidence scores. I have used TensorFlow and Keras libraries to load the model, process an input image, and decode the model's predictions.

TensorFlow - TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning framework developed by the Google Brain team. It is widely used for various machine learning and deep learning tasks, including neural networks, natural language processing, computer vision, and more. TensorFlow provides a flexible and efficient way to build, train, and deploy machine learning models.
Keras - Keras is a high-level neural networks API that serves as an interface for building and training deep learning models. Originally developed as an independent project, Keras was later integrated into TensorFlow as its official high-level API. It simplifies the process of designing, experimenting with, and training neural networks by providing a user-friendly and consistent interface.
